# Multimodal-Ground-based-Cloud-Database1
The TJNU multimodal ground-based cloud database (MGCD) is collected in Tianjin, China from 2017 to 2018. It contains 8000 multimodal ground-based samples. According to the International cloud classification system criteria published in the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) as well as the visual similarity of cloud in practice, the sky conditions are divided into seven sky types: 1) cumulus, 2) altocumulus and cirrocumulus, 3) cirrus and cirrostratus, 4) clear sky, 5) stratocumulus, stratus and altostratus, 6) cumulonimbus and nimbostratus, 7) mixed cloud. Besides, cloud images with cloudiness no more than 10% are categorized into the clear sky. The MGCD is composed of 4000 training samples and 4000 test samples from seven classes, and each sample comprises one ground-based cloud image and a set of multimodal cloud information which are one-to-one correspondence. The cloud images are captured by a sky camera with fisheye lens and stored in JPEG format with the pixel resolution of 1024×1024. The multimodal cloud information collected by a weather station includes temperature, humidity, pressure and wind speed, and is stored in a vector with four elements. All the samples are cooperatively annotated by the meteorologists and the ground-based cloud researchers. The MGCD will be provided free of charge to cloud-related researchers in order to promote research. Hereunder, some ground-based cloud images from each class are presented.
